## v1.2.2

*Format-High.ps1*: When a window width is unknown use 80 as the default. As a
result, it works in PowerShell ISE, too. 80 is normally too small there but
data are shown, not an error. Then a proper width may be specified manually.

*Assert-SameFile.ps1*: PromptForChoice did not work in PS v2.0

## v1.1.1

*Show-Coverage.ps1*: fixed links in HTML.

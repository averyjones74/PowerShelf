.Synopsis
	Tests PowerShell debugging with breakpoints.
	Author: Roman Kuzmin

.Description
	This scripts helps to get familiar with all kinds of breakpoints, i.e.
	command, variable (reading, writing, reading and writing), and custom
	actions. It is also used for testing of debuggers (Add-Debugger.ps1).

	On the first run the script sets some breakpoints in itself. Run it again
	in order to see how the debugger works when breakpoints are hit. In order
	to remove test breakpoints invoke Test-Debugger.ps1 -RemoveBreakpoints.

	With built-in debuggers it is ready to use, e.g. with
	- ConsoleHost
	- Windows PowerShell ISE Host
	- FarHost (in the main session)

	Use it with a custom debugger, e.g. Add-Debugger.ps1, with
	- Default Host (simple calls of PowerShell from .NET)
	- Package Manager Host (Visual Studio NuGet console)
	- FarHost (editor console with a local session)

.Parameter RemoveBreakpoints
		Tells to remove breakpoints set for this script.

.Example
	>
	# How to use in NuGet console which does not have own debugger

	# add debugger
	Add-Debugger.ps1

	# test breakpoints
	Test-Debugger.ps1 # set
	Test-Debugger.ps1 # run

function TestFunction2 { # you have stepped into TestFunction2
	param($int, $text, $data)
	'In TestFunction2'
}

# test a command breakpoint
TestFunction1 # in v2 it stops at this line, in v3 at `function TestFunction1 {`

# non terminating error does not enter debugging mode
Write-Error 'This is non terminating demo error.' -ErrorAction Continue

# terminating error triggers the StackTrace breakpoint
try { Write-Error 'This is terminating demo error.' -ErrorAction Stop }
catch { $_ }

# to change the variable in debugger
[int]$toWrite = 0 # change me after
if ($toWrite -le 0) {
	"Nothing to write."
}
else {
	"Writing..."
	1..$toWrite
}

# steps in one line
if ($true) { $_ = 1 } # step through the pieces of command

$varRead = 1 # no break
$_ = $varRead # break on reading

$varWrite = 2 # break on writing
$_ = $varWrite # no break

$varReadWrite = 3 # break on writing
$_ = $varReadWrite # break on reading

# the counter was updated by the breakpoint action
"Watched variables have been accessed $($script:VarAccessCount) times."
